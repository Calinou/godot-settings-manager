# Godot Settings Manager

An autoload to make settings management easier.

## Features

- Manage multiple configuration files easily.
  - For instance, to make it easier for users to backup their settings,
    you can have one "user" settings file containing user preferences,
    one "system" settings file containing system-dependent settings
    and a "cache" settings file with temporary values that can be
    safely deleted.
- Centralized storage for default values in the Project Settings.
  - No more duplication if you need to use the same setting in several places.
- Smart, resilient saving.
  - Saves settings automatically when quitting.
  - Saves settings if a setting was changed recently, with a short debounce
    delay to avoid unnecessary I/O. This way, settings are preserved if the
    project crashes.
